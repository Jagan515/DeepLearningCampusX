## **1. 1940s–1950s: Birth of the Idea**

* Scientists got inspired by the human brain.
* **1943:** McCulloch & Pitts created the *first mathematical neuron*.
* **1957:** Rosenblatt made the **Perceptron**, the earliest simple neural network.
* Computers were weak, so progress was slow.

## **2. 1960s–1980s: Winter & Slow Growth**

* Neural networks couldn’t solve complex problems.
* Governments stopped funding.
* This period is known as the **AI Winter**.
* Still, researchers discovered **backpropagation** (the algorithm that helps neural networks learn) in the 1980s.

---

## **3. 1990s: Computing Improves, Ideas Grow**

* More data and slightly better computers.
* Neural networks used for basic tasks like handwriting recognition (MNIST dataset).
* Internet slowly started providing more data.

---

## **4. 2000–2010: Start of Big Data Era**

Why deep learning started rising:

* **Smartphones came** → huge amounts of photos, videos, voice data.
* **Internet exploded** → tons of text data.
* **GPUs** (made for gaming) were discovered to train neural networks faster.
* Cloud computing started.

Researchers like **Geoffrey Hinton**, **Yann LeCun**, **Yoshua Bengio** revived neural networks with new ideas.

## **5. 2012: The Big Bang of Deep Learning**

This was the turning point.

* In 2012, Hinton’s team created **AlexNet**, a CNN model.
* It crushed all competitors in the ImageNet competition.
* Suddenly, deep learning became the best method for:

  * image recognition
  * face recognition
  * speech-to-text
  * object detection

This year is considered the moment **deep learning exploded**.

## **6. 2013–2017: Rise of CNNs & RNNs**

Different architectures became famous:

### **CNNs** → vision

Used for:

* medical images
* self-driving cars
* facial recognition

### **RNNs, LSTM, GRU** → sequence

Used for:

* text prediction
* speech recognition
* translation

Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple started training huge models because they now had:

* billions of smartphone photos
* fast GPUs/TPUs
* cloud data centers

---

## **7. 2017: Transformers Arrive (Revolution Begins)**

Google introduced **Transformers** in a paper called **Attention is All You Need**.

Transformers solved problems:

* RNNs were slow
* Long sequences couldn’t be handled
* Training took too much time

Transformers were:

* faster
* more accurate
* more parallel

This changed AI forever.

---

## **8. 2018–2020: Large Language Models (LLMs)**

Transformers created models like:

* **BERT** (Google)
* **GPT-1, GPT-2 (OpenAI)**

AI became extremely good at:

* understanding text
* translation
* summarization
* answering questions

The size of models grew from:

* millions → billions → trillions of parameters

---

## **9. 2020–2022: AI becomes part of daily life**

Deep learning powered:

* Siri & Google Assistant
* YouTube recommendations
* Instagram filters
* Face unlocking on phones
* Google Maps predictions
* Medical diagnoses
* Chatbots on websites

GANs created:

* fake faces
* AI art
* realistic animations

---

## **10. 2022–Now: Generative AI Era (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Gemini, Claude)**

* **ChatGPT** launched with GPT-3.5 → world shocked.
* GPT-4, Claude, Gemini broke new records.
* AI can now:

  * write code
  * analyse data
  * generate images
  * write essays
  * solve exams
  * answer like humans
  * reason, plan, understand context

Transformers + huge data + massive GPUs made this possible.

AI is now running on:

* smartphones
* laptops
* robots
* cars

Deep learning is used in:

* self-driving vehicles
* fraud detection
* healthcare
* customer service
* gaming
* finance
* agriculture
